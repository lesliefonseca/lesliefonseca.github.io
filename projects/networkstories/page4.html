    <p class="paragraph"><span class="fade-text">A Japanese room might be likened to an inkwash painting</span>, the paper-paneled shoji being the expanse where the ink is thinnest, and the alcove where it is darkest. Whenever I see the alcove of a tastefully built <span class="fade-text"> Japanese room </span>, I marvel at our comprehension of the secrets of shadows, <span class="fade-text">our sensitive use of shadow and light.</span> For the beauty of the alcove is not the work of some clever device. An empty space is marked off with plain wood and plain walls, so that the light drawn into it forms dim shadows within emptiness. There is nothing more. And yet, when we gaze into the darkness that gathers behind the crossbeam, around the flower vase, beneath the shelves, though we know perfectly well it is mere shadow, we are overcome with the feeling that in this small corner of the atmosphere there reigns complete and utter silence; that here in the <span class="fade-text">darkness immutable tranquility holds sway.</span></p>

    <p class="paragraph">  The <span class="fade-text"> "mysterious Orient"</span> of which <span class="fade-text"> Westerners speak probably refers to the uncanny silence of these dark places</span>. And even we as children would feel an inexpressible chill as we peered into the depths of an alcove to which the sunlight had never penetrated. Where lies the key to this mystery? illtimately it is the <span class="fade-text">magic of shadows</span>. Were the shadows to be banished from its comers, the alcove would in that instant revert to mere void.
    This was the genius of our ancestors, that by cutting off the light from this empty space they imparted to the <span class="fade-text">world of shadows</span>  that formed there a quality of mystery and depth superior to that of any wall painting or ornament. The technique seems simple, but was by no means so simply achieved. We can imagine with little difficulty what extraordinary pains were taken with each invisible detail-the placement of the window in the shelving recess, the depth of the crossbeam</p>
