    <p class="paragraph"> the height of the threshold. But for me the most <span class="fade-text"> exquisite touch is-the pale white glow of the shoji in the study bay </span>; I need only pause before it and I forget the passage of time.
    The study bay, as the name suggests, was originally a projecting window built to provide a place for reading. Over the years it came to be regarded as no more than a <span class="text-fade">source of light for the alcove</span>; but most often it serves not so much to illuminate the alcove as to soften the sidelong rays from without, to filter them through paper panels. There is a cold and desolate tinge to the light by the time it reaches these panels. The little sunlight from the garden that manages to make its way beneath the eaves and through the corridors has by then <span class="fade-text"> lost its power to illuminate, seems drained of the complexion of life</span>. It can do no more than accentuate the whiteness of the paper. I sometimes linger before these panels and study the surface of the paper, bright, but giving no impression of brilliance</p>

    <p class="paragraph">In <span class="fade-text">temple architecture</span> the main room stands at a considerable distance from the garden; so dilute is the light there that no matter what the season, on fair days or cloudy, morning, midday, or evening, the pale, white glow scarcely varies. And the <span class="fade-text">shadows at the interstices of the ribs seem strangely immobile</span>, as if dust collected in the corners had become a part of the paper itself. I blink in uncertainty at this dreamlike <span class="fade-text"> luminescence, </span> feeling as though some misty film were blunting my vision. The <span class="fade-text">light</span> from the pale <span class="fade-text"> white</span> paper, <span class="fade-text"> powerless</span> to dispel the heavy darkness of the alcove, is instead repelled by the darkness, creating a world of confusion where <span class="fade-text">dark and light are indistinguishable.</span> Have not you yourselves sensed a difference in the light that suffuses such a room, a rare tranquility not found in ordinary light? Have you never felt a sort of fear in the face of the ageless, a fear that in that room you might lose all consciousness of the passage of time, <span class="fade-text"> hat untold years might pass and upon emerging you should find you had grown old and gray? </span>t</p>
