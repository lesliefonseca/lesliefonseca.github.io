    <p class="paragraph">And surely you have seen, in the darkness of the innermost rooms of these huge buildings, to which sunlight never penetrates, how the gold leaf of a sliding door or screen will pick up a distant glimmer from the garden, <span class="fade-text"> then suddenly send forth an ethereal glow </span>, a faint golden light cast into the enveloping darkness, <span class="fade-text">like the glow upon the horizon at sunset.</span> In no other setting is gold quite so exquisitely beautiful. You walk past, turning to look again, and yet again; and as you move away the golden surface of the <span class="fade-text">paper glows ever more deeply</span>, changing not in a flash, but growing slowly, steadily brighter, like color rising in the face of a giant. Or again you may find that the gold dust of the background, which until that moment had only a dull, sleepy luster, will, as you move past, suddenly gleam forth as if it had burst into flame.</p>

    <p class="paragraph"><span class="fade-text">How, in such a dark place, gold draws so much light to itself is a mystery to me.</span> But I see why in ancient times statues of the Buddha were gilt with gold and why gold leaf covered the walls of the homes of the nobility. Modem man, in his well-lit house, knows nothing of the beauty of gold; but those who lived in the dark houses of the past were not merely captivated by its beauty, they also knew its practical value; for gold, in these <span class="fade-text">dim rooms</span>, must have served the function of a reflector. Their use of gold leaf and gold dust was not mere extravagance. Its <span class="fade-text"> reflective properties</span> were put to use as a source of <span class="fade-text"> illumination</span>. Silver and other metals quickly lose their gloss, but gold retains its brilliance indefinitely to light the darkness of the room. <span class="fade-text"> This is why gold was held in such incredibly high esteem.</span></p>
