    <p class="paragraph">And so it has come to be that the beauty of a <span class="fade-text"> Japanese room </span>depends on a <span class="fade-text">variation of shadows </span>, heavy shadows against light shadows-it has nothing else. <span class="fade-text">Westerners</span> are amazed at the <span class="fade-text">simplicity of Japanese rooms,</span> perceiving in them no more than ashen walls bereft of ornament. Their reaction is understandable, but it betrays a failure to comprehend the <span class="fade-text">mystery of shadows</span>. Out beyond the sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at best but barely reach, we extend the eaves or build on a veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a remove. The light from the garden steals in but dimly through paper-paneled doors, and it is precisely <span class="fade-text"> this indirect light that makes for us the charm of a room. </span> We do our walls in neutral colors so that the sad, fragile, dying rays can sink into absolute repose. The storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such may have a glossy finish, but the walls of the sitting room will almost always be of day textured with fine sand.  </p>

    <p class="paragraph"> A luster here would destroy the <span class="fade-text">soft fragile beauty of the feeble light.</span> We delight in the mere sight of the delicate <span class="fade-text">glow of fading rays clinging to the surface</span> of a dusky wall, there to live out what little life remains to them. We never tire of the sight, for to us this <span class="fade-text">pale glow and these dim shadows far surpass any ornament</span> And so, as we must if we are not to disturb the glow, we finish the walls with sand in a single neutral color. <span class="fade-text">  </span>The hue may differ from room to room, but the degree of difference will be ever so slight; not so much a difference in color as in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in the mood of the viewer. And from these <span class="fade-text "> delicate differences in the hue of the walls, the shadows in each room take on a tinge peculiarly their own</span>
    Of course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove, and in it a hanging scroll and a flower arrangement.</p>
