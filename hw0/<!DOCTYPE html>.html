        <h1>Core 2 Interaction: Lab – Questionnaire</h1>
        <h2> 1.Describe your previous experience with code </h2>
        <p> The courses I have taken that initially exposed me to coding were intro to computer programming back in high school, “Time” my freshman year at Parsons, and Core Interaction 1. In all of these classes we covered very basic HTML and CSS. </p>
       <h2> What parts resonate with you</h2>
        <p> I really enjoyed my programming class back in high school since it was extremely beginner-friendly, It kind of catapulted my interest in design.</p>
        <h2>  What parts were most confusing</h2>
        <p> The most confusing part regarding coding is definitely styling, I feel like I always get lost once CSS is in introduced. </p>
        <h2> 2. How excited about learning code are you? Are you nervous about learning code? If so, why? What can I do in this class to help reduce this anxiety?</h2>
        <p>I’m pretty excited about properly learning to code! I can't lie and say I’m not nervous, I dont feel like I’m the most computer savvy and I tend to freak out when things aren't looking correctly. Something I feel has helped me a lot in past courses is recorded videos of each lesson we learned. </p>
        <h2> 3. How do you imagine coding fitting in with the rest of your design curriculum and career after college?</h2>
        <p> I aspire to work in media and publishing companies, more specifically children's media. I feel like coding would elevate my chances of getting a better position or role in a company , all the while exposing me to different avenues of design I might later enjoy.</p>
        <h2> 4. What text editor do you prefer to use? </h2>
        <p>I have a bit of experience with Brackets, but I prefer using Visual Studio Code</p>
        <h2> 5. Have you used GitHub before? Do you know what it is? Describe your understanding of GitHub.</h2>
        <p>Last semester my professor tried introducing Github, but we never really went through with it, my understanding of Github is very little.</p>
        <h2> 6.Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Try using a unique analogy to describe this relationship. Bonus points for creative analogies.</h2>
        <p> testing testing </p>
        <h2> 7.Using each HTML heading tag, list your favorite foods ranked by importance </h2>

          <li> <p><a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards</a></p></li>   <p>Awwards is such a helpful site, especially if quite burnt out and dont have any idea on how you want your projects too look</p>
          <li> <p><a href="https://www.behance.net/">Behance</a></p></li>     <p> I used behance so much last semester, especially when trying to find mock ups and new fonts</p>
          <li> <p><a href="https://www.are.na/">Are.na</a></p> </li>          <p> Are.na was introduced by my typography professor last year, I've found it quite helpful for references and inspiration </p>

         <h2>Describe the difference between block, inline-block and inline elements</h2>
        <p> From my understanding a Block is an html element that begins a new line on a web-page and extends, while an inline-block does not start a new line but you can set its width. Inline elements occupy spaces defined by the main element</p>
