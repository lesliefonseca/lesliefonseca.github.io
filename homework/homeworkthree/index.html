    Moving to New York in August meant I had a lot of exploring to do before the school year started, I found joy walking through the High Line. Im lucky enough it's main entrance is five minutes away from my dorm.
    I especially loved the trail during the months of October and November.

    Looking through these pictures are making me miss the fall weather, it allowed me to sight see often. I would often visit Central Park and hold picnics with my friend, it was especially nice since the leaves were changing colors

    Every fall I listen to the same artist, Belle and Sebastian and Beabadoobee, it definetly feels different listening to these albums here in NYC.
