  <h1>Early Life</h1>
  <p> Aurora was born in Massachusetts and grew up in both Queens, New York and Stamford, Connecticut. Her family immigrated to Queens from India after the 1984 anti-Sikh pogroms in which her maternal uncle was killed, and her family's business was burned down. She was raised in a traditional Sikh household. She became exposed to R&B, Soul, Jazz and Folk music in middle school, which piqued her interest in music and influenced her musical style later in life. She studied at New York University Tisch School of the Arts.</p>
  <h1>Career</h1>
  <article>
   <p> Aurora started working with record producer Everett Orr in 2015. She amassed a sizable online following after the release of her first EP, Shanti in December 2017. Shanti explored themes of self-love and healing, and blended R&B, soul, and jazz music.[8] Her debut EP drew praise from Sidney Madden of NPR for her "cool delivery and chill-inducing falsetto runs" and "astute songwriting chops".[9] She directed several of her own music videos where she displayed her Indian heritage and "rich interiority of women of color like herself".[10]
    In the summer of 2018, she was included in ModCloth's Say It Louder campaign, which aimed to celebrate individuality and strong female icons in music. She was featured alongside other outspoken female musicians like Lizzo, Awkwafina and Hayley Kiyoko.[11] In November 2018, she performed at Tyler, The Creator's Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival.[12]
    In March 2019, Aurora co-headlined the Java Jazz Festival in Jakarta, Indonesia, with H.E.R and Toto.[13]
    On May 31, 2019, she released her debut album Lucid, distributed through Empire Distribution.[14] Lyrically, she explored sensuality, healing from trauma, and spirituality; through tracks like "Stronger" and "Salt Water", she opened up about her experience as a sexual assault and abuse survivor.[15][16] Lucid was met with very positive reviews. Sidney Madden of NPR described Lucid as "comforting but nuanced, balancing cultures old and new by mashing up contemporary R&B with traditions from the South Asian diaspora".[17] In a track review for the penultimate track, "Petal", Vrinda Jagota from Pitchfork wrote: "over the course of 12 songs, her sound becomes bolder and clearer, finding strength in everything from sun showers to her motherâ€™s resilience to her own femininity and womanhood".[18] "Lucid" was named one of the "Best Albums of 2019" by NPR.[19] Aurora's 2019 single "Stronger" was named one of the "100 Best Songs of 2019" by Noisey.[20]
     Aurora announced her sophomore album, Asha's Awakening, in January 2022.[21] The record was created as a concept album from the perspective of a Punjabi space princess.[1] The release was preceded by the singles "Rush" and "Secret," with the latter featuring American rapper Vince Staples.[22] Asha's Awakening was released on February 11, 2022 and received positive reviews from critics.[23]
