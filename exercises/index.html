   <h1>Screen Time Activity</h1> 
   <h2>Noor, Interviewed by Leslie</h2>
   <p>
    I try to limit my screen time as much as possible so that I can be more present, more productive, and have more time to do things that I’d like to do. The app that I tend to use the most is instagram. While I try to limit this as much as possible, sometimes I still spend more time on it than I would like. For example, I unfollowed a lot of pages and replaced them with ones that uplift me, make me laugh, or teach me something. Besides this, I would say I use Spotify a lot for music and podcasts, but it’s more of a passive way of using it. Lastly, the third app that I use the most is Google. I use it for anything and everything that pops into my head, whether I want to learn, understand, or research something. Other than these three, my usage of other apps really varies and is pretty minimal depending on what I’m doing that day. My average screen time tends to be between 2-5 hours on my phone and really varies from day to day within this range.
